        <h5 class="u-align-justify u-custom-font u-text u-text-2">Dafne, Debi, Irmak and Nil h​ave been working on their application’s coding, design and company establishment all year round during the club times. As a result of their efforts, they were awarded by a trip to Silicon Valley including the World Pitch conference.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>During the time they spent in the Silicon valley, they visited multiple companies including Google HQ, Google Ventures, Nvidia an NASA. All of these companies they’ve visited thought them different perspectives of entrepreneurship in different subjects. Not only they visited the companies but they had the chance to meet with the staff working there and present their projects in front of them to get feedback. The finalists were able to come together with a group formed by Nvidia, an AI company, members and they exchanged ideas about entrepreneurship, technology usage in our daily life.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Lastly, the team members shared their experiences with the finalists to shape up their perspectives about being an entrepreneur researching/working in technology. As the finalists they also had the opportunity to present their ideas and project with Google Ventures team as World Pitch presentations approached. They got one last feedback on their projects and presentations from experienced members of Google Ventures who showed them details and tricks they never thought about before.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The final presentations were at AMD’s headquarters. Teams were given a desk in the exhibit area to display their poster which they made during their trip with beforehand preparations, this exhibit was just an overview of their projects before the actual presentations began.&nbsp;All the teams were given 5 minutes to deliver their idea and projects to the judges.<br>
          <br>The pride and excitement of being able to present their projects to people in senior positions in the world's leading companies gave the finalists an unrepeatable experience. Before the World Pitch ended, our team presented their project with the poster they’ve displayed to participants and outside visitors.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Receiving a huge interest for their ideas from people all over the world showed them that a small idea can make an impact not just on a small community. As the world pitch comes to an end our finalists returns home with the experiences they gained to continue their future plans with those experiences and knowledges shaping their ideas.
